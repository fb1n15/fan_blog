-   ### **Notes**
	- The country's situation is nearly hopeless. The former _New York Times_ reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner is known for his radical politics. So it’s no surprise that his latest outing takes the position that America is an empire in its dying days. The country, he argues, has been overtaken by corporate interests, triggering a crisis on both a collective material level and an individual psychic one. *An empire is declines once it starts to 吃老本, e.g., print money to 解决财政危机*
	- ### Chapter 1: Decay:
		- The terrible consequences of deindustralisation. American workers are laid off, and formerly vibrant American cities, without a tax base, are having to sell to private companies fundamental assets such as their water systems.
	- ### Chapter2: Heroin:
		- 
	- ### Chapter3: Work
		- unemployment, marriage failure, loss of social cohesion and declining health (individulism is responsible)
		- Man must attach himself to a purpose that is greater than himself and which outlives him. 
		- Life is only tolerable if one can see some purpose in it.
		- Hedges sees little hope for the church as a vehicle of social change. The liberal churches, he says, hold up multiculturalism and identity politics as their main concern, while ignoring economic and social justice. Meanwhile, fundamentalist churches preach that prosperity is a sign that one is right with God.
		- Debs called for a social safety net including old age pensions and unemployment insurance. He got in trouble in 1918 when he denounced American participation in World War I, claiming that it was a capitalist war in which the working class was being used as cannon fodder, and denouncing the Wilson administration’s persecution of anti-war activists, trade unionists and socialists.
	- ### Chapter2: Sadism
		- violence and commodification of human beings for profit are the quintessential expressions of global capitalism. Our corporate masters are pimps.
	- ### Chapter : freesom
		- Empires need a persuasive mystique. But the old tricks of the CIA no longer work.
		- Hedges says in his final chapter, “Freedom”, that we are now in an “interregnum”, an era in which the reigning ideology has lost effectiveness but has yet to be replaced by a new one.  The death blow to the American empire, he says, will come when the dollar is no longer the worldwide currency standard. When that happens, the economy will contract, U.S. Treasury bonds will be worthless, and the United States will no longer be able to maintain its global military power.
